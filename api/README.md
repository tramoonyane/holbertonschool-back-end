What Bash scripting should not be used for

Bash scripting is powerful for automating tasks in a Unix-like environment, but it should not be used for:

    Complex software development: Bash is not suitable for large, complex applications due to its limited features and error handling capabilities.
    Applications that require high performance: Bash scripts are typically slower compared to compiled languages like C or efficient interpreted languages like Python.
    Applications that require advanced data structures: Bash lacks native support for complex data structures.
    Applications that require portability across different environments: Bash scripts can be less portable due to differences in shells and system configurations.

What is an API

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs define how requests and responses are formatted and specify the functions, methods, or endpoints that can be called by other applications.
What is a REST API

A REST API (Representational State Transfer API) is a type of API that adheres to the principles of REST architecture. REST APIs use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) for communication, allowing clients to access and manipulate resources on the server. REST APIs are stateless, meaning each request contains all the necessary information, and resources are represented in standard formats like JSON or XML.
What are microservices

Microservices is an architectural style where applications are built as a collection of small, independent services. Each service focuses on a specific business capability and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. Microservices communicate with each other through APIs, often using REST or other communication protocols.
What is the CSV format

CSV (Comma-Separated Values) is a simple file format for tabular data. In CSV files, each line represents a row of data, and columns are separated by commas. CSV files are commonly used for data import and export between different applications.
What is the JSON format

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON represents data using key-value pairs (objects) and ordered lists (arrays). It is widely used in web APIs and data storage.
Pythonic Package and module name style

In Python, package and module names should be in lowercase, using underscores (_) to separate words if necessary. For example: my_package, my_module.
Pythonic Class name style

Pythonic class names should follow the CapWords (CamelCase) convention, where the first letter of each word is capitalized and there are no underscores. For example: MyClass, AnotherClass.
Pythonic Variable name style

Pythonic variable names should be in lowercase, using underscores (_) to separate words if necessary. For example: my_variable, another_variable.
Pythonic Function name style

Pythonic function names should be in lowercase, using underscores (_) to separate words if necessary. For example: my_function, another_function.
Pythonic Constant name style

Pythonic constant names should be in uppercase, using underscores (_) to separate words if necessary. For example: MY_CONSTANT, ANOTHER_CONSTANT.
Significance of CapWords or CamelCase in Python

CapWords or CamelCase is a naming convention in Python where words are capitalized and concatenated without underscores. It is primarily used for class names to distinguish them from functions, variables, and constants, which use lowercase or lowercase with underscores. Using this convention improves code readability and helps maintain consistency in Python code.
